GM is a turn based strategy game. Players have the ability to place their Avatar and other troop types on a grid game field in order to engage the other Avatar*, Artifact* or their troops. Players spend X points per turn to either move, attack, defend or upgrade. The strategy is to either defeat the player opponent by destroying the Artifact or defeating the Avatar.
